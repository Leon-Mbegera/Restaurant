# Restaurant

Restaurant is a website for my coffee shop that has three parts to it. One, a warm and welcoming home page with an image of the restaurant and some good message. And, a menu page showing what we serve at the spot. It also has a contacts page where we've given details of our location and contacts for customers to feel free to reach us.
